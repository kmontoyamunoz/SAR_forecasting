# SAR_forecasting - Project under construction

**SAR Regional model - Microsimulation do-files.**

This project adapts the LAC microsimulation model to SAR countries by differentiating labor market changes by skill level and translating income changes into consumption impacts to forecast country-level poverty, inequality, and other distributive indicators. See the LAC technical paper here: https://documentsinternal.worldbank.org/search/34100000. 

**Note 1:** The do-files that generate the Microsimulation tool information can be found in the _tool_ sub-folder. The remaining do-files are associated with the microsimulation model.

**Note 2:** The do-files are specific to the next _Spring Meetings 2025_ version.

**Note 3:** The _programs_ folder includes subprograms in MATA that are essential for running the simulations. Please do NOT modify them.
